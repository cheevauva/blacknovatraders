    Greetings and welcome to BlackNova Traders!
    <BR><BR>
    This is a game of inter-galactic exploration. Players explore the universe, trading for commodities and 
    increasing their wealth and power. Battles can be fought over space sectors and planets.

    <B>Long-range scan:</B><BR>
    Scan a neighboring sector with your long range scanners without actually moving there.
    {% if allow_fullscan %}
        A full scan will give you an outlook on all the neighboring sectors in one wide sweep of your 
        sensors.
    {% endif %}
    <BR><BR>
    <B>Ships:</B><BR>
    Scan or attack a ship (if it shows up on your sensors) by clicking on the appropriate link on the right 
    of the ship's name. The attacked ship may evade your offensive maneuver depending on its tech levels.
    <BR><BR>
    <B>Trading ports:</B><BR>
    Access the port trading menu by clicking on a port's type when you enter a sector where one is present.
    <BR><BR>
    <B>Planets:</B><BR>
    Access the planet menu by clicking on a planet's name when you enter a sector where one is present.
    <BR><BR>
    {% if allow_navcomp %}
        <B>Navigation computer:</B><BR>
        Use your computer to find a route to a specific sector. The navigation computer's power depends on

    <B>RealSpace:</B><BR>
    Use your ship's engines to get to a specific sector. Upgrade your engines' tech level to use RealSpace

    movement or you can target any sector using the 'Other' link. 
    <BR><BR>
    <B>Trade routes:</B><BR>
    Use trade routes to quickly trade commodities between ports. Trade routes take advantage of RealSpace 
    movements to go back and forth between two ports and trade the maximum amount of commodities at each 
    end. Ensure the remote sector contains a trading port before using a trade route. The trade route 
    presets are shared with the RealSpace ones. As with RealSpace moves, any sector can be targeted using 
    the 'Other' link
